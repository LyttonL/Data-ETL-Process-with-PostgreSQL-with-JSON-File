# Data-Extraction-with-PostgreSQL-with-JSON-File
n this project, I worked with over 100 JSON files collected from a startup called Sparkify.  The goal was to create a Postgres database named Sparkifydb and perform an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. The database consists of five tables: users, songs, time, artists, and songplays.
